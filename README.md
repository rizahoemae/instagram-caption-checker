## ❓ WHY i made this
You may have seen this post before. Well, I'm a frontend developer, but my current activity is being a seller and managing a business store on social media, especially Instagram. I spend most of my time selling products, promoting, designing, and analyzing at the same time. Yes, it's pretty hard, but tools like [Meta Business](https://business.facebook.com/) make my workload much easier. I always schedule posts so that I don't have to manually post at the exact time I want to upload. However, after posting many contents, I often face an issue where the captions suddenly disappear. At first, I thought it was due to the internet, cache, or business meta itself, as people often say in their [website tutorials](https://www.google.com/search?q=caption+disappear+on+instagram&oq=caption+disappear+on+instagram+&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i22i30j0i390i650.5069j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). But then I remembered that I updated the same caption on Instagram and it still said that I was unable to update the post. Through testing, I found out that it was because of the caption itself. I didn't know that Instagram has caption guidelines and limitations for posts. So, here I am, creating a tool (originally to help myself) that I hope can help many others out there. It is still under development. If you find any bugs, please [contact me](https://www.instagram.com/daripadadikepala/).
